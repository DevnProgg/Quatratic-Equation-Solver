# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Description

This is a simple C++ program that parses a quadratic equation from a user-input string and solves it using the quadratic formula. The program can handle both positive and negative coefficients and provides solutions for real and complex roots.

## Features

- *Input Parsing*: The program reads a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 from a user-provided string.
- *Coefficient Extraction*: It extracts the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the string using regular expressions.
- *Quadratic Formula*: The program calculates the roots using the quadratic formula.
- *Root Types*: The program determines whether the roots are real and distinct, real and identical, or complex, and outputs the appropriate results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Basic knowledge of how to compile and run C++ programs.
